## Hi there 👋 I'm Will

I'm a **Full-Stack Software Engineer working in FinTech**, building and supporting production systems using **Spring Boot** on the backend and **React (Next.js)** on the frontend. I also work with **data analysis and visualisation** to turn complex data into useful insights.

I recently started creating **tech content on YouTube** to share what I’m learning and to stay current with modern tools, architectures, and best practices:
